# DataPipelineETL
This is my data pipeline for Orange Tunisia
## First things First 
we go to the directory after pulling it from my repository 
then we do :
### sudo su 
### docker-compose up -d 
Everything will be pulled automatically 
Then we need to give execute , read  , write permissions to our cluster so 
### chmod -R 777 ./
